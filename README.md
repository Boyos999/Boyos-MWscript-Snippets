# mwscript snippets
This repo contains various snippets of mwscript I have written. These should be considered examples, not something you copy-paste directly into CS since you will have to change IDs, variable names, etc. I use them as a reference because mwscript is weird and full of odd behavior. Comments have been added to each snippet to explain function.

## Variable naming
In these snippets I use generic names (control/controlQ/timer/etc). You can use whatever variable names you want in most cases.

### additional note
While I don't recommend copy pasting scripts into CS, someone made a vscode extension for mwscript for text highlighting.
